console.log(2>1);
console.log(2==1);
//Above outputs will be in booleans (true/false)

console.log("2" > 1); //"2" will automatically get converted to a number and give output in boolean respective to the condition

console.log(null > 0);
console.log(null == 0);
console.log(null >= 0);
//equality check (==) and comparisons (> < <= >=) work differently in js. So
//Comparisons convert null to 0 by treating is as number but in equality check it'll be not converted
